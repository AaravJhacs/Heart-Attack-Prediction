# Heart-Attack-Prediction
Heart Attack Prediction: EDA and Analysis
This project predicts heart attack risk based on medical history and blood test results. It considers factors like age, sex, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression during exercise, peak exercise ST segment slope, major vessel coloration by fluoroscopy, and thallium stress test.

The combined factors undergo statistical tests to generate an output between 0 and 1, indicating a high likelihood of heart attack (1) or a low likelihood (0).
